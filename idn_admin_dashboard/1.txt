Frequently Asked Questions
How can we register domain names in Indian Languages ?
Check the availability of your desired domain name: You can check if your desired domain name is available in Indian languages by visiting the website of the National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) or any accredited registrar that offers Indian language domains.
Choose a registrar: Once you have identified an available domain name, you need to choose a registrar that offers Indian language domains. NIXI provides a list of accredited registrars on its website that offer Indian language domains.
Provide the necessary information: You will need to provide your personal and contact information, as well as the desired domain name and the language/script in which it is written. You may also need to provide additional documentation or verification for Indian language domains.
Complete the registration process: Once you have provided the necessary information, you can complete the registration process through the registrar's website. You may need to pay a registration fee and agree to the terms and conditions of the registrar.
Configure your domain: Once your domain is registered, you can configure it for use with your website, email, or other online services.
It's important to note that the availability of domain names in Indian languages may vary depending on the script and language. Additionally, Indian language domains may have specific requirements or restrictions, so it's important to check with the registrar or NIXI for more information.
How Universal Acceptance can be achieved?
To achieve universal acceptance, it is important for all stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem, including domain name registries, email service providers, application developers, and others, to adopt and implement technical standards that support non-ASCII domain names and email addresses. Additionally, education and awareness-raising efforts can help promote universal acceptance and ensure that users are aware of the options available to them.
What are the Universal Acceptance Guidelines?
The Universal Acceptance (UA) Guidelines are a set of best practices and recommendations for supporting the use of all domain names and email addresses, regardless of their script, language, or format. The guidelines were developed by the Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG), a community-led initiative that works to promote Universal Acceptance of all domain names and email addresses.
The UA Guidelines provide detailed recommendations for software and system developers, domain name registries, email service providers, and other stakeholders involved in the management and implementation of Internet systems and applications. The guidelines cover a wide range of topics related to Universal Acceptance, including:
- Domain name registration and administration
- Email address validation and handling
- IDN implementation and support
- Web and application development
- Testing and validation
- User education and awareness
How can we get Email ID in Indian Languages?
To get an email ID in Indian languages, you can follow these steps:
Choose an email service provider: There are several email service providers that offer support for email IDs in Indian languages, such as Google, Microsoft, and Rediffmail. You can choose an email service provider that offers support for your preferred Indian language.
Check the availability of your desired email ID: Once you have chosen an email service provider, you can check if your desired email ID is available in Indian languages. You may need to check the provider's website or contact their support team for more information.
Create a new email account: If your desired email ID is available, you can create a new email account with your chosen email service provider. You will need to provide your personal and contact information, as well as choose your desired email ID and language.
Configure your email settings: Once your email account is created, you can configure your email settings to suit your preferences, such as setting up filters, forwarding, or other email management options.
Start using your email ID: Once your email account is set up and configured, you can start using your email ID in Indian languages for sending and receiving emails.
It's important to note that not all email service providers offer support for email IDs in Indian languages, and the availability of languages may vary depending on the provider. Additionally, some Indian languages may have specific requirements or restrictions, so it's important to check with the email service provider for more information.

Shri S. Krishnan
Secretary (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology)
Internet has transformative potential in democratizing access to information, yet its true efficacy lies in its multilingual adaptation. By championing the Universal Acceptance initiative, India stands as a shining beacon of diversity, embodying the essence of universal acceptance and inclusivity.
Shri Sushil Pal
Joint Secretary (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology)
Collection of networks defines the internet but networks are incomplete without the Universal Acceptance. For accelerating digital inclusion, the one thing that we can do certainly is to use the language of the people to connect them to the Internet.
Dr. Devesh Tyagi
CEO ( NIXI )
India is proud to champion a more inclusive and accessible internet for all. At NIXI, we are firmly committed to fostering a universal acceptance environment where everyone can access information and participate online in their preferred language.
